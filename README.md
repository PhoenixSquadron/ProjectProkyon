Project Description: 

The paramount concern in each and every industry is safety. In particular, it is an extremely forefront concern in the oil and gas industries. The high demand and expected rate of delivery of gas place high amounts of strain on both infrastructure and employees, necessitating a swift workflow and space-efficient infrastructure, all while managing the enormous amounts of highly flammable gas. However then comes the careful balancing act between speed and safety, with miles and miles of pipeline to traverse and inspect, and valuable operational time lost scanning areas for inspection. We propose a fully autonomous and self-contained UAV inspection solution capable of operating in GPS-denied environments without pre mapping or external computers required, utilizing advanced real-time path planning g algorithms utilizing a LiDAR and stereoscopic SLAM system along with a modular GSS ( Gas Sensor Suite), with a max capacity of 10kg. Such a system will greatly improve operational efficiency by not necessitating a dedicated UAV crew to pilot the UAV, and will also be arrive-and-deploy, as no additional preparation is required other than the drone and ground equipment, making this system a valuable and time-saving investment.
